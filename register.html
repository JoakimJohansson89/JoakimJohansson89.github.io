        <p>At the moment this section serves no real purpose other than allowing me to have a look at and fiddle with some database code.</p>
        <p>Update: After several hours of trying to get the python-backend code to handle the register logic to work with the javascript and html pages,
            I've come across a bug/issue that seems well established on forums like StackOverflow. Apparently somethings off with how CORS (a security feature in apps)
            responds to requests from other domains (or something to that nature), it has a workaround with launching a proxy nginx server to bypass the CORS controll.
            At the moment it feels like this "little code brainteaser" has escalated far and beyond, with implementation of more libs, more servers etc. As of now this 
            create account/database project is at a halt. It simply takes too much time from other projects to be worth it. The code is still up on github if anyone has some supersmart one-liner to fix it.</p>
