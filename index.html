            My name is Joakim Johansson, I'm 35 years old. I live with my family consisting 
            of my girlfriend and our two boys. They're 1 and 3 years of age, they keep us quite occupied to say the least.
            When I'm not changing diapers I'm an IT-Security student at IT-HÃ¶gskolan of Gothenburg.
            Our education is more of a defensive security mindset, compared to our sister-program: Security-tester (ethical hackers).
            During my time at the school I've learned a broad range of skills. A common part of nearly every course,
            is the fact that our teachers really like Linux. So whenever we're labbing or looking at shell-code it's almost everytime Linux based.
            We got some Python experience (the Flask app running the Gandalf Wisdom on this website is python based). 
            We've looked at cryptography, symmetric and asymmetric, at rest and in-transit cryptography etc.
            Quite a long course for Virtualisation and Cloud.</p>
            
            
            <p>In the second year of my educaiton it was time for some hands on experience
            in the real world. I got an internship at Cuebid West AB. An IT-secruity consultant firm. Cuebid is quite heavily involved
            in managing networks for their customers. I needed to sharpen up my networking skills to say the least.
            We agreed I would pursue the CCNA certificate. It was quite the challenge to study for the cert, while also
            doing other "internship things", and since the internship was only 8 weeks long (I'll return in the spring-time),
            I didn't have time to finish the CCNA study, we agreed I'd continue during the fall on my own. This Novemember I finally feelt ready,
            (note: I was studying for school aswell simultaneously). By just a little inch I passed on my first try, it was nervewrecking to say the least.
            But I'm rather contempt and proud to manage that on my own, while also being pre-occupied with my two little boys and fulltime-education.
            Should note I've also managed to acquire some other certs, including some basic Fortinet theory, Fortinet firewall configuration.
            Some ethical hacking certs from TryHackMe also. I'll add some more info here as time goes along.
