                    <h3>Project 1: Network Configuration Backup</h3>
                    <p>Description: A project consisting of a Python-code, which purpose is to extract
                        configuration info into a text-file for backup-purpose. Ongoing and incomplete. However since I can't in an affordable way get my hands on a switch this project is currently at a halt.
                        I'll figure something out on how to get my hands on a network-device but nothing so far. Have a look at the Gandalf tab meanwhile :)
                        I'll add Github links here once that's sorted. As of now I just think it looks neat with the Python-esc colouring on the black background.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Project 2: Website, which also turned out to be a Gandalf Quote Generator</h3>
                    <p>Description: The website you're browsing, a simple project of learning some .html/js/css code, and adding some Python on that.
                        I'm not looking to become a .net developer, simply get some hands on xp of different codes languages and try and build a webpage from scratch.
                        The website code consists of some filetabs written in html, some css for styling,
                        and the Gandalf quote generator is a python code Flask app which needs a server to run it. On that there's some JS code for 
                        "triggering" the Flask app via the website. Also looking to expand the app into a docker environment with docker compose, which triggers the Flask app on startup. 
                    Right now the web-service Render is being used to run the gandalf_app.py module, generating images and quotes of your favorite wizard.
